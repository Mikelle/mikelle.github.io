Inside Polygon zkEVM's sequencer. Batch processing, prover coordination, L1 finality, and reorg handling.

## The Sequencer's Role

The sequencer is the heart of a zkEVM. It:

- Receives transactions from users
- Orders them into batches
- Coordinates with the prover
- Submits proofs to L1

## Batch Processing

Transactions are grouped into batches for efficiency. Each batch gets a ZK proof.
