How MEV evolved from simple arbitrage to sophisticated pre-confirmation systems. The path from Flashbots to mev-commit.

## What is MEV?

Maximal Extractable Value (formerly Miner Extractable Value) refers to the profit that can be extracted by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block.

## The Evolution

1. **Early days** — Simple arbitrage bots competing in mempool
2. **Flashbots era** — Private mempools, MEV auctions
3. **PBS** — Proposer-builder separation
4. **Pre-confirmations** — Committing to inclusion before the block

## Where we're heading

The future is about giving users guarantees. Pre-confirmations let you know your transaction will be included before the block is even built.
