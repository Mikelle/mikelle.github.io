Been reading about shared sequencing designs. The future isn't one L2 winning — it's all of them talking to each other. Espresso, Astria taking interesting approaches.

The key insight: if multiple L2s share a sequencer, atomic cross-chain transactions become possible. No more bridges, no more waiting.

Still early, but this feels like the right direction.
